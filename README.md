# 🐍 PYTHON-PROGRAMMING  
Hey now we have our **Zero to Hero Python codes!** 😎  

---
 
### 💡 Below are the steps to install Python on your personal computer or laptop 
*(Choose your operating system and follow the instructions carefully)*  

---

# 🐧 Getting Started with Python on **Linux**

Follow these steps to quickly run your first Python program 🚀  

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Open Terminal  
👉 Press **`Ctrl + Alt + T`** or search for *“Terminal”* in your app menu.  


---

## 🔍 Step 2: Check if Python is Installed  

Run the following command:  

```bash
python3 --version
````

✅ If you see the latest version like `Python 3.13.7` or `Python 3.12.1`, you’re good to go!
❌ If not, install Python using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```
---

## 📝 Step 3: Create a Python File

Make a file with a `.py` extension, for example:

```bash
Main.py
```

✍️ This file will contain your Python code.

---

## ▶️ Step 4: Run the Created Python File

Type in terminal:

```bash
python3 Main.py
```

---

## ✅ Run Successful!

🎉 Congratulations! You just executed your first Python program on **Linux**.

---

# 🪟 Getting Started with Python on **Windows**

Follow these steps to quickly run your first Python program 🚀

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Download and Install Python

👉 Go to the official Python website:
🔗 [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Click on **“Download Python 3.x.x”** (latest version).

Run the installer and make sure to **check this box before installing**:
✅ “Add Python to PATH”

Then click **Install Now**.

> 💡 **Note:**
> You cannot install Python using `pip install python` because `pip` comes *with* Python.
> So you must install Python first — this also automatically installs `pip` for you.

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Verify Python Installation

After installation, open **Command Prompt (cmd)**:
Press **`Win + R`**, type `cmd`, and hit **Enter**.

Now type:

```bash
python --version
```

✅ If you see something like `Python 3.13.7` or `Python 3.12.1`, it means Python is installed successfully.
❌ If you get an error, restart your PC and check again.

---

## 📝 Step 3: Create a Python File in any folder(copy that directory)

Open **Notepad** or **VS Code**, and write a simple program:

```python
print("Hello, World! 👋")
```

Save the file with a `.py` extension, e.g.

```
Main.py
```

---

## ▶️ Step 4: Run Your Python File

In **Command Prompt**, you need to **navigate to the folder** where your Python file is saved.
You can do this in **two simple ways:**

### ✅ Option 1: The Easy Way (Recommended)

If you already copied the folder path in **Step 3**, simply type:

```bash
cd
```

Then **right-click** in the Command Prompt and **paste** the copied directory path, for example:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Pankaj\Desktop\Python
```

and press **Enter**.

---

### ✅ Option 2: The Manual Way

If you don’t have the path copied, you can manually navigate like this:

```bash
cd path\to\your\folder
```

For example:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Pankaj\Documents
```

---

Once you’re inside your project folder, run your Python file using:

```bash
python Main.py
```

💡 **Tip:** If your system uses `python3` instead of `python`, try:

```bash
python3 Main.py
```

✅ You should now see your output like this:

```
Hello, World! 👋
```

🎉 Congrats! You’ve successfully run your first Python program on **Windows** 🚀
